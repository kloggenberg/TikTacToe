Tik-Tac-Toe

This is one of my first python projects. To run this program you need to install python's pygame using the following command:
"pip install pygame"

This program has to ways to run it, a text-based aswell as a a gui-beased version. To get more information how to run the application please run the help command using:
"python3 main.py help"

There are still imporvemtns that need to be made to my small project, but all the logics seems to be working just fine.

I will updat, the respositories soon to make the gui version more visually pleasing.

Thanks For Looking At My Work.
